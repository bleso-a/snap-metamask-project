This is an application that uses MetaMask Snap to store and manage information about books. The inspiration for this application was the need to manage my physical book library and then add a digital link to stored information.

This application uses MetaMask Snap to store book information, and it presents an opportunity to delete any book item and also delete all the books in the library.
